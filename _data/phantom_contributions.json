To address these issues, we developed a digital reference object (DRO) aimed at validating image acquisition and analysis methods for accurately measuring rCBV in glioblastomas. The DRO was developed using trained physiological and kinetic parameters derived from in vivo data, unique voxel-wise 3D tissue structures, and a validated MRI signal computational approach. The DRO’s ability to produce reliable signals was validated by comparison to separate cohort of patient data.",

Fluid dynamics simulations predicted that maximum mixing would occur near the central axis of the perfusion compartment. Experimentally observed signal changes within this region were reproducible and well fit by the standard Buxton General Kinetic Model. Calculated perfusion rates, averaged over the entire phantom volume, agreed with the expected volumetric flow rates provided by the flow pump. Phantom sensitivity to pCASL labeling parameters was also demonstrated. Observed perfusion and transit time values were reproducible and within the physiological range for brain perfusion.",
