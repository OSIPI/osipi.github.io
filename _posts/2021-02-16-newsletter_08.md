Update on OSIPI Milestones and Deliverables due in February 2021 (IN PROGRESS)

**Task force 3.2 (Clinical and preclinical data)** has completed its first deliverable - an inventory (list) of publicly available perfusion datasets along with a tabulated list of descriptors for each dataset. Public feedback is invited and encouraged, and collected systematically.
