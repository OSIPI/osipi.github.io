title: "OSIPI Task Force 1.1: ASL software inventory"
aims: Create an inventory of open source ASL packages
description: |
  The inventory is aimed at end-users looking for a suitable tool to process their ASL images. The inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users. Currently, all ASL pipeline developers are kindly asked to fill a [short questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-4_pBXFA31htMNPZo1kQgcY0EJ5_AWxjyvkkYIQVGUHo6sg/viewform) to specify the features of their pipelines.

#### Call for ASL pipelines
A first version of the ASL pipeline [inventory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ-1GF2fmz6Q4IukuKP_-57H-xi872Xq_uBlX5P0Cwpj4RYd_t73pvZ64UqXegPaVpQJhQQrVRJRPro/pub) is available online containing the self-assessed features of the majority of publicly available ASL pipelines. Currently, we work on a more objective pipeline comparison together with the developers. If you wish to have your pipeline included in the inventory or in the comparison, please fill in the following [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-4_pBXFA31htMNPZo1kQgcY0EJ5_AWxjyvkkYIQVGUHo6sg/viewform). See more details in the [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRbxX9ywttwQfd2hyj62h676RjEZ3YHZBIBTkUmEb2nqOmrRVd-PlWeL6nAsJ79akQpXHmtBIizJiOK/pub#id.2i4c3golnmp9).
