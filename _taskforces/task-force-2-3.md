title: "OSIPI Task Force 2.3: DCE/DSC contributions"
aims: Collect and harmonise DCE/DSC code snippets from developers
description: |
  Task force 2.3 will develop a library of open-source functions, scripts and pipelines for DCE/DSC perfusion imaging analysis. 
  This is aimed at developers of DCE/DSC perfusion methods looking for specific functionality or development templates, or who want to share their own in-house developments with others. 
  Contributions will be sourced from the community, and may include individual functions and more complete pipelines in various programming languages. 
  Task force 2.3 will organise these in a coherent and well-documented library structure as defined by task force 2.1, then identify and develop any missing functionality.

### DSC/DCE-MRI Code Collection
Most Taskforce 2.3 activity is now taking place in our public [DSC-/DCE-MRI Python code repository](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection) on Github.  
Documentation is being developed in the repository [wiki](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection/wiki).
Over time this will be extended and unit testing implemented. Please contact the leads if you are interested in joining the taskforce or in contributing code.
