title: "OSIPI Task Force 6.1: ASL Challenges"
aims: Develop and implement challenges involving ASL perfusion imaging analysis
description: |
  Task force 6.1 will develop challenges using that can act as broadly recognised benchmarks for perfusion software. This will include the development of metrics that quantify the performance of a perfusion analysis tool (eg. bias and precision on DROs, agreement with reference methods in-vivo, reproducibility on in-vivo data, processing time, etc).
  The challenges will use data collected by OSIPI and will be applied to the software tools listed in OSIPI in order to establish a set of benchmarks. 
  The long-term aim is to establish OSIPI as an independent arbiter for software solutions in perfusion imaging.
