# Getting Started

Welcome to the **OSIPI Documentation Hub**

!!! info "What is OSIPI?"
    **OSIPI** (Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging) is an initiative of the ISMRM, aiming to improve transparency, standardization, and reproducibility in perfusion MRI. This site hosts documentation for lexicons, tools, and code repositories developed by OSIPI task forces.

## Who is this for?

!!! note ""
    This hub is designed for:
    
    - 🧠 **Researchers** analyzing perfusion MRI data  
    - 👩‍💻 **Developers** contributing tools or algorithms  
    - 🩺 **Clinicians** using MRI in practice  
    - 🌐 Anyone aiming to support reproducibility and interoperability

## Start here

!!! tip "Explore the key sections"
    - 📚 **Lexicons**  
      Standardized terminology for ASL and contrast-agent based perfusion MRI  
    - 🧪 **Code Repositories**  
      Python and MATLAB tools for DCE, DSC, ASL, and IVIM analysis  
    - 🛠️ **Tools**  
      Web-based utilities for dataset validation and artifact reporting
