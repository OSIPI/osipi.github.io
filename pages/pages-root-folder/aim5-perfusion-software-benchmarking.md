**Benchmarking: Development of benchmarks and application to existing software** 

Using the data collected in aim 3, develop metrics that quantify the performance of a perfusion analysis tool (eg. bias and precision on DRO’s, agreement with reference methods in-vivo, reproducibility on in-vivo data, processing time, …). These metrics will be measured for the software tools collected in aims 1 and 2 in order to establish a set of benchmarks. The long-term aim is to establish OSIPI as an independent arbiter for software solutions in perfusion imaging.

**Task force 5.1. Development of benchmarks** (will open when aims 1-3 have progressed)
