The **Executive and Management Board (EMB)** of OSIPI is the central body responsible 
for the execution of the strategic plan and ongoing management of OSIPI. 

![Organigram]({{ site.urlimg }}organigram-emb.png)

The EMB defines a *Roadmap* that sets out deliverables and milestones, 
monitors its implementation, and reports back to the [ISMRM Perfusion Study Group](https://www.ismrm.org/study-groups/perfusion-mr/) ahead of the annual ISMRM meeting. 

The EMB consists of the OSIPI leadership team and one co-lead for each task force. Meetings are held quarterly.
