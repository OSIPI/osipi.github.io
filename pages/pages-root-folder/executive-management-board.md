The **Executive and Management Board (EMB)** of OSIPI is the central body responsible 
for the execution of the strategic plan and ongoing management of OSIPI. 
The EMB consists of 4 members nominated by the ISMRM perfusion study group (past chair, chair, co-chair, secretary). Each is appointed for 1 year with a rotation on the annual meeting of the ISMRM, when a new secretary is nominated by the study group and the past chair rotates off.

The EMB defines a *Roadmap* that sets out deliverables and milestones, 
monitors its implementation, and reports back to the [ISMRM Perfusion Study Group](https://www.ismrm.org/study-groups/perfusion-mr/) ahead of the annual ISMRM meeting. 

The EMB consists of the OSIPI leadership team and one co-lead for each task force. Meetings are held quarterly.
