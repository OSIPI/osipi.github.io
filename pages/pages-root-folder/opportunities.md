**Open Challenges**
-------------------

**ASL Challenge**  
Pipeline developers and users are invited to participate in a community-based challenge aiming to establish an optimal analysis pipeline for ASL MRI.  
*Please get in touch with [Task Force 6.1](/task-force-6-1/) to join now!*

**DSC/DCE Challenge**  
The OSIPI challenge on " Quantitative Contrast Perfusion MRI (QCP-MRI)":
- Call for submission: all interested teams are invited to compete in this challenge that aims to establish a set of benchmarks for quantification of Ktrans from DCE-MRI scans of brain tumors. 
- Call for participation: we invite interested pipeline developers to participate in independent replication of the proposed workflows submitted by the competing groups. 
  
*Please get in touch with [Task Force 6.2](/task-force-6-2/) leads for more information!*
