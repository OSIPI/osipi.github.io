**Software inventory aim: Develop a comprehensive inventory of complete open source packages for perfusion imaging analysis**

The inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users.
