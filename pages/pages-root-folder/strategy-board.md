---

The Strategy Board (SB) represents the stakeholders within OSIPI and maintains the Strategic Plan outlining the mission, aims and general approach of OSIPI. If needed the SB will also propose changes to the OSIPI governance for approval by the ISMRM perfusion study group.

![Organigram]({{ site.urlimg }}organigram-sb.png)

The SB consists of the OSIPI leadership team, the perfusion study group governing committee, and any number of
advisory members representing other bodies with an interest in perfusion open source software. 
This could include other ISMRM study groups, other societies or more informal networks.

If you are interested to represent an external body within the SB, please contact the OSIPI chair.
