**Aim Perfusion Code Library: Develop a library of open-source functions, scripts and pipelines for perfusion imaging analysis** 

This is aimed at developers of perfusion methods looking for specific functionality or development templates, or who want to share their own in-house developments with others. Contributions will be sourced from the community, and may include individual functions and more complete pipelines in various programming languages. OSIPI will organise these in a coherent and well-documented library structure, then identify and develop any missing functionality.
